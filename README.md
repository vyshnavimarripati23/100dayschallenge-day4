This contains about Stack and Queues.

Stacks...................................

A linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.
Imagine a stack of plates: you push a new plate on top, and you pop the top plate first.

Operations
push(x) → insert an element on top.
pop() → remove the top element.
peek() / top() → view the top element without removing it.
isEmpty() → check if the stack is empty.
isFull() → check if the stack is full (in case of fixed size).

Queues........................................

A linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.
Think of a queue in a ticket counter: the person who comes first gets served first.
Operations
enqueue(x) → insert an element at the rear.
dequeue() → remove an element from the front.
peek() / front() → get the front element without removing it.
isEmpty() → check if the queue is empty.
isFull() → check if the queue is full (in case of fixed size).
